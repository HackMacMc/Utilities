If you dont Know what a Rainbow Table is then here is a Snippet from The Wikipedia Artical.
```
    A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering the plaintext password, up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a form of time-memory tradeoff, using less CPU at the cost of more storage. Proper key derivation functions employ a salt to make this attack infeasible.
